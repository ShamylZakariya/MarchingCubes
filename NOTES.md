# Currently
- Re-introduce the broken arches, random boulders, etc to terrain
- Update atmosphere shader to use a spherical threashold instead of planar for fog
- fix camera rotation issues, rapid mouse look seems to slew the up vector
- Use ray marching against the terrain function to position camera.
- Look into [blue-noise temoporal offsetts](https://blog.demofox.org/2020/05/10/ray-marching-fog-with-blue-noise/) for fog
