# Currently
- Have greeble sampler provide material properties
- move terrain sampler material state to the sample functor
- Update atmosphere shader to use a spherical threshold instead of planar for fog
- Look into [blue-noise temoporal offsetts](https://blog.demofox.org/2020/05/10/ray-marching-fog-with-blue-noise/) for fog
    - https://ijdykeman.github.io/graphics/simple_fog_shader
- Use ray marching against the terrain function to position camera.
